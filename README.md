# ShuffleDeck
A program in which I have created in order to take one or multiple decks of cards, a standard or UNO deck, and shuffle them.
The program will begin with prompting the user for which type of deck they would like. A standard or UNO deck of cards.
Next, the user will be prompted with how many decks of cards they would like to use.
From there the program will generate a deck of cards based on the user's answers and then display a non-shuffled deck of cards.
Finally the program will take the non-shuffled deck of cards, shuffle it, and then display it to the user.
